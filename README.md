# Doc-UFCN

This Python 3 library contains a public implementation of Doc-UFCN, a fully convolutional network presented in the paper [Multiple Document Datasets Pre-training Improves Text Line Detection With Deep Neural Networks](https://teklia.com/research/publications/boillet2020/). This library has been developed by the original authors from [Teklia](https://teklia.com).

The model is designed to run various Document Layout Analysis (DLA) tasks like the text line detection or page segmentation.

This library can be used by anyone that has an already trained Doc-UFCN model and want to easily apply it to document images. With only a few lines of code, the trained model is loaded, applied to an image and the detected objects along with some visualizations are obtained.

### Getting started

To use Doc-UFCN in your own scripts, install it using pip:

```console
pip install doc-ufcn
```

### Usage

To apply Doc-UFCN to an image, one need to first add a few imports (optionally, set the logging config to make logs appear on stdout) and to load an image. Note that the image should be in RGB.
```python
import cv2
import logging
import sys
from doc_ufcn.main import DocUFCN

logging.basicConfig(
    format="[%(levelname)s] %(message)s",
    stream=sys.stdout,
    level=logging.INFO
)

image = cv2.cvtColor(cv2.imread(IMAGE_PATH), cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
```

Then one can initialize and load the trained model with the parameters used during training. The number of classes should include the background that must have been put as the first channel during training. By default, the model is loaded in evaluation mode. To load it in training mode, use `mode="train"`.
```python
nb_of_classes = 2
mean = [0, 0, 0]
std = [1, 1, 1]
input_size = 768
model_path = "trained_model.pth"

model = DocUFCN(nb_of_classes, input_size, 'cpu')
model.load(model_path, mean, std, mode="eval")
```

To run the inference on a GPU, one can replace `cpu` by the name of the GPU. In the end, one can run the prediction:
```python
detected_polygons = model.predict(image)
```

### Output

When running inference on an image, the detected objects are returned as in the following example. The objects belonging to a class (except for the background class) are returned as a list containing the confidence score and the polygon coordinates of each object.
```json
{
  1: [
    {
      'confidence': 0.99,
      'polygon': [(490, 140), (490, 1596), (2866, 1598), (2870, 140)]
    }
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

In addition, one can directly retrieve the raw probabilities output by the model using `model.predict(image, raw_output=True)`. A tensor of size `(nb_of_classes, height, width)` is then returned along with the polygons and can be used for further processing.

Lastly, two visualizations can be returned by the model:
  * A mask of the detected objects `mask_output=True`;
  * An overlap of the detected objects on the input image `overlap_output=True`.


By default, only the detected polygons are returned, to return the four outputs, one can use:
```python
detected_polygons, probabilities, mask, overlap = model.predict(
    image, raw_output=True, mask_output=True, overlap_output=True
)
```

### Models

We provide an open-source model for the page detection task. To download the model and load it one can use:
```python
from doc_ufcn import models
from doc_ufcn.main import DocUFCN

model_path, parameters = models.download_model('generic_page_detection')

model = DocUFCN(len(parameters['classes']), parameters['input_size'], 'cpu')
model.load(model_path, parameters['mean'], parameters['std'])
```
By default, the most recent version of the model will be downloaded. One can also use a specific version using the following line:
```python
model_path, parameters = models.download_model('generic_page_detection', version="0.0.2")
```
